K-Means,"Created customer segmentation models (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to impro...","In this context, 'K-Means' refers to a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data. 

'K-Means' is a clustering technique that groups similar data points into 'k' clusters based on their characteristics or features. The algorithm works by:

1. Initializing 'k' centroids (or cluster centers) randomly.
2. Assigning each data point to the closest centroid.
3. Updating the centroids by calculating the mean of all data points in each cluster.
4. Repeating steps 2 and 3 until the centroids converge or a stopping criterion is met.

'K-Means' stands for 'K-Means Clustering', where 'K' is a constant that represents the number of clusters (or groups) you want to identify in your data. The algorithm groups similar data points into these clusters based on their characteristics (features).

Think of it like categorizing customers into different segments based on their demographics, behavior, or preferences. For example, you might group customers into clusters based on their age, location, or purchase history. This helps businesses like yours to create targeted marketing campaigns that appeal to specific customer segments, increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.

'K-Means' is a method that groups similar data points into clusters based on their characteristics or features. The 'K' in K-Means stands for the number of clusters that the algorithm is trying to identify.

Here's a simplified explanation:

1. The algorithm starts by randomly selecting initial cluster centers.
2. It then assigns each data point to the cluster with the closest center.
3. The algorithm recalculates the cluster centers based on the assigned data points.
4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the cluster centers no longer change significantly.
